1. Connected - if you can visit all the edges[[], []].
2. Each DFS pass, is one connected components. see ConnectedComponents problem
3. Graph is tree if - It has n - 1 edges[[], []] and fully connected
4. Topological sort - DFS (make sure there is no Undone course and a visited node which is cycle)
